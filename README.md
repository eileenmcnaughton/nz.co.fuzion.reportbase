nz.co.fuzion.reportbase

========================

This is the base class for other report classes

It helps to provide feature parity and compatibility
 between versions of CiviCRM and provides the basis for advanced features such as being
able to select which contact to show custom data for 
(e.g both ends of the relationship).

It facilites reports to work despite changes in core between 4.2, 4.3 & 4.4
e.g the renaming of contribution_type_id to financial_type_id
